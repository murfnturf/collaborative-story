You would never guess what can happen when you jump into a seemingly shallow puddle at night time!
It turns out that it is not a puddle rather than a giant hole which brings you to a new world on the other side of the light water.
Now you are left stunning and don't know what to do.
So you decide to call your best friend  who lives in another underground lair.
You can't believe your eyes. There are magical creatures of all shapes and sizes in all directions!
You tried to walk, but your body was not listening to you and it was very difficult to make a step
So you reached out your arm as far as it would go to see if you could touch a creature.
Just as you are about to touch one of the creatures the world around you suddenly shatters like a glass pane.
And that's when you realise that the world you've been living in has been made of marshmallows all along
That's the moment when you take your first bite into the soft and sweet world around you.
It tastes like... To your surprise, what should've been a soft sweet bite of marshmallow turned out to sting
with ghost pepper like spiciness. You thought, "how could such a delicious treat make my tongue burn?"
It wasn't the first time you have tried such a spice.
